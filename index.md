# Overview

The journey of a researcher is a long one; every researcher will accumulate an
abundance of research qualifications, publications, presentations, awards, and
teaching experience over time. As a result, a curriculum vitae (CV for short) is
an absolute necessity for job applications and annual performance reviews in the
academic, public, or private sectors, as well as just keeping track of publications.

In the academic world, LaTeX is the standard formatting language and for good
reason: LaTeX makes formatting easy for maintenance and quick updates. It's for
this very reason that I've created a CV entirely in LaTeX. To further tailor
this for academics, the CV has integration with the awesome [biblatex package](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex)
to easily update and maintain publications of all kinds.

Please note that because I'm an Economics PhD candidate and applied
macroeconomist on the 2025--26 job market, the files for this CV are customised
for an economist that is going on the job market in mind. As such, some code
and conventions might not be relevant for your own research needs!

## Prerequisites

To work with the source code and tailor this CV for your own needs, you will
need the following installed:

* Latest version of MikTeX or TeXLive.
* The following LaTeX packages: [newtxttext](https://ctan.org/pkg/newtx), [fontenc](https://ctan.org/pkg/fontenc),
[geometry](https://ctan.org/pkg/geometry), [ragged2e](https://ctan.org/pkg/ragged2e),
[fancyhdr](https://ctan.org/pkg/fancyhdr), [xcolor](https://ctan.org/pkg/xcolor),
[url](https://ctan.org/pkg/url), [hyperref](https://ctan.org/pkg/hyperref),
[booktabs](https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs), [fmtcount](https://ctan.org/pkg/fmtcount),
[refcount](https://ctan.org/pkg/refcount), [datetime](https://ctan.org/pkg/datetime),
[titlesec](https://ctan.org/pkg/titlesec), [lastpage](https://ctan.org/pkg/lastpage),
[paralist](https://ctan.org/pkg/paralist), [enumitem](https://ctan.org/pkg/enumitem),
[array](https://ctan.org/pkg/array), and [biblatex](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex).

```

* `\maketitle` after `\begin{document}` inserts the header box into the LaTeX
document. Afterwards, the rest of the .tex file outputs a typical LaTeX document
with `\section` commands.
* Sections that may have many columns with detailed information, such as
"Education" and "Teaching history" in my own CV, are structured as tabular
environments with the columns specified as paragraphs. This configuration allows
for flexible management of the column widths in order to prevent horizontal
overflow and crashing into the margins.
* To insert publications into the document, use the `\begin{publications}` environment.
  * Each `\printbib` command will insert a subsection that contains all
  publications in that category, in chronological and descending order, and
  sorted by name within each year.
    * Sorting specifics can be modified within the [biblatex](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex)
    package options in the .sty file.
  * The .sty file has options to display certain .bib entries, such as "abstract".
  This is especially useful for academics in the economics field, as displaying the
  abstract of your job market paper saves the search committees a lot of time when
  reviewing your application. There are also other customisations on how your .bib
  entries will output into the CV.

    ```latex
      %% Showing abstracts for biblatex entries (useful for JMCs IMO. Less useful when finished with the job market and can turn off to save space)
      \renewbibmacro*{finentry}{
        \setunit{\finentrypunct\par}
        \usebibmacro{abstract}
        \finentry
      }

      %% Making URL label for bibliography items appear in uppercase and same size as DOI font IN THE SITUATION small caps exist for the font
      \DeclareFieldFormat{url}{{\footnotesize URL}\addcolon\space\url{#1}}

      %% Shortening URLs in .bib files to display only "URL" if desired
      % \DeclareFieldFormat{url}{\href{#1}{\mkbibacro{URL}}}

      %% Remove "In:" for an article citation
      \renewbibmacro{in:}{%
        \ifentrytype{article}{}{
          \printtext{\bibstring{in}\intitlepunct}
        }
      }
    ```

  * The total number of publication items (e.g., refereed and working papers)
  listed inside the `publications` environment is calculated, converted into an
  integer, and displayed in the CV using the `fmtcount` package. The page
  numbers for the publications section are also stored inside of the `\printbib`
  command with the labels `\label{pubitemsstart}` and `\label{pubitemsend}`.
  These allow you to output them in the CV using the `\pageref` command. All of
  these configurations can be found inside of the .sty file.
  * You're allowed to have `\printbib` commands outside the `publications`
  environment, but the associated .bib items will not be counted towards the
  total number of publications.

    ```latex
      %% Creating publications environment
      \newenvironment{publications}{
        %% Creating label for the beginning of the publications environment for \pageref usage
        \label{pubitemsstart}
        \vspace*{0cm}
        \titlespacing{\section}{0pt}{1.5ex}{1ex}\itemsep = 0.00cm
      }{
        %% Creating label for the end of the publications environment for \pageref usage
        \label{pubitemsend}
        \addtocounter{sumpapers}{-1}
        \refstepcounter{sumpapers}
        \label{sumpapers}
      }
      \def\printbib#1{
        \printbibliography[category = #1, heading = #1]\lastref{sumpapers}
      }

      %% Counting total number of items included in the publications environment
      %% Sumpapers will naturally count everything contained inside of the publications environment. However, if you include categories
      %% inside of the environment that you don't want to be included into the sumpapers value, the following comments provide guidance on
      %% how to adjust the variable to display the value you want. As a reminder, .bib items added after and outside of the publications
      %% environment do not get added into the total value of sumpapers.
      %% Initialising the counter for pubitems to be 0.
      \newcounter{pubitems}\setcounter{pubitems}{0}

      %% Initialising the counter for total value sumpapers to be 0.
      %% If you want to remove x publication items from being included in the total value of sumpapers, simply replace 0 with -x.
      \newcounter{sumpapers}\setcounter{sumpapers}{0}

      %% Defining sumpapers to be the sum of the sub-totals of pubitems in every category listed inside of the publications environment.
      \def\lastref#1{
        \addtocounter{#1}{
          \value{pubitems}
        }
        \setcounter{pubitems}{0}
      }

      %% Add all papers in the bib files
      \nocite{*}
