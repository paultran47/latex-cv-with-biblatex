  abstract = {\textit{Abstract}: This paper shows that financial markets need more time than the standard 30 minutes to fully react to monetary policy announcements. I systematically estimate these optimal window lengths using a neural network text analysis method. I find that the required time increases with asset underlying maturity (reaching 50--60 minutes for maturities at least two quarters ahead) and FOMC statement characteristics: complexity, novelty, and dissents. This timing difference has economic consequences: optimal windows correct for the attenuated impact of monetary policy shocks about forward guidance on interest rates, break-even inflation, and equity prices, and yield more precise macroeconomic responses.}

  title = {Deciphering Financial Market Reactions to OPEC Announcements: A Neural Network Approach},

  note = {SSRN Working Paper No 4968664},
  abstract = {\textit{Abstract}: This paper shows that OPEC communications affect oil supply expectations, oil prices, and the macroeconomy beyond the effects of setting production limits and changing current production. Using neural network methods for text analysis, I create a new oil supply expectations ``text shock'' from OPEC statements that is derived from variation in oil futures prices purified of noise, demand information, and endogenous responses to global economic activity. The ``purified surprises'' correlate with 74\% of the observed supply surprises. Impulse responses from vector autoregressions using my shock do not exhibit output puzzles and are more consistent with theory than those previously reported.}
