  abstract = {\textit{Abstract}: This paper shows that financial markets need more time to fully react to Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy announcements than typically assumed. Using finance literature techniques and neural network methods for text analysis, I systematically estimate that on average, markets fully react to the information content of FOMC statements within an event window ending at least 30 minutes after release. This optimal window increases with the underlying maturity of an asset, reaching 50--60 minutes in length for maturities at least two quarters ahead. Additionally, statements with greater complexity, less similarity, and dissents are associated with longer event windows on average. I find that the correlation between monetary policy surprises measured within optimal versus conventional 30-minute windows decreases with asset underlying maturity. These differences alter the forward guidance component of monetary policy shocks and magnify their estimated impact on interest rates, break-even inflation, and equity prices. Furthermore, monetary policy shocks constructed in optimal windows results in the responses of macroeconomic variables to become more precise.}

  title = {Deciphering Financial Market Reactions to OPEC Announcements: A Neural Network Approach},
  doi = {10.2139/ssrn.4968664},

  note = {SSRN Working Paper No 4968664},
  abstract = {\textit{Abstract}: This paper shows that OPEC communications affect oil supply expectations, oil prices, and the macroeconomy beyond the effects of setting production limits and changing current production. Using neural network methods for text analysis, I create a new oil supply expectations ``text shock'' from OPEC statements that is derived from variation in oil futures prices purified of noise, demand information, and endogenous responses to global economic activity. The ``purified surprises'' correlate with 74\% of the observed supply surprises. Impulse responses from vector autoregressions using my shock do not exhibit output puzzles and are more consistent with theory than those previously reported.}
